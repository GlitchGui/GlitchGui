- 👋 Hi, I’m @GlitchGui
- 👀 I’m interested in AI and the possible connection between the brain and technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a new script id like to design in the far future; Chino/CHNO script; once I am certified and can put more into it other then just names and cool graphic and functional ideas. 
- 📫 How to reach me @natesmith165 on Instagram or on linkedIn as Nathan Smith
